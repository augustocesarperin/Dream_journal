# Progress: Lynchian Dream Journal

## 1. What Works

*   **Core Loop:** Users can create a dream entry (description required, title optional), request a Lynchian-styled interpretation from the Gemini API (via Cloudflare worker), and save the dream (title, description, interpretation, date) locally using `shared_preferences`.
*   **Dream Listing:** Saved dreams are displayed chronologically on the main screen.
*   **Dream Viewing:** Users can view the full details of a saved dream.
*   **Dream Deletion:** Users can delete a saved dream from the details screen (`TelaDetalhesSonho`) via an AppBar action, which calls the appropriate service method.
*   **UI:** Basic UI structure is functional, including navigation between screens.
*   **Theming:** A dark, red-accented "Lynchian" theme is applied consistently.
*   **Interpretation Proxy:** The Cloudflare Worker successfully proxies requests to the Gemini API, applies the specific prompt, and handles basic errors.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling and user feedback (Snackbars, UI messages) are present for API calls and loading states.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Analyze

*   ~~**Fix Deletion Bug:** The "Delete" button UI exists but doesn't call the `excluirSonho` service method. Needs implementation.~~ (Resolved: Button removed from entry screen, functionality added to details screen)
*   ~~**Address Storage Mismatch:** Decide on the storage strategy:
    *   **Option A:** Remove the unused Cloudflare KV code from the worker.
    *   **Option B:** Update the Flutter app (`ServicoApiCloudflare`) to use the worker's `/sonhos` endpoints for CRUD operations backed by KV (replacing `shared_preferences`). This would enable potential future cloud sync features.~~ (Resolved: Unused KV code removed from worker; using `shared_preferences` only).
*   **Refine UI/UX:** Further polish the UI, potentially improve loading/error states, consider font changes (as per TODO in `AppTema`), fix "Data" label in entry screen.
*   **Add Features (Optional):** Consider features currently out of scope (e.g., search, filtering, settings).
*   **Testing:** Implement unit, widget, and integration tests.

## 3. Current Status

*   Full codebase analyzed.
*   Memory Bank updated.
*   Core functionality (entry, interpretation, local saving, listing, viewing, deletion) is implemented using `shared_preferences` for storage.
*   Cloudflare worker acts solely as an interpretation proxy.
*   Ready for UI refinements or other improvements.

## 4. Known Issues

*   ~~**Deletion Bug:** Delete button in `TelaEntradaSonho` is non-functional.~~ (Resolved)
*   ~~**Storage Mismatch:** Flutter uses `shared_preferences`, Cloudflare Worker has unused code for KV storage.~~ (Resolved)
*   **Potential UI Glitch:** The "Data" label for the Title field in `TelaEntradaSonho` seems incorrect.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial architecture likely intended Cloudflare KV for storage, but implementation pivoted (or was incomplete) to use `shared_preferences` in the Flutter app.
*   Decision made to stick with `shared_preferences` and remove unused KV code from the Cloudflare worker to simplify the architecture.
